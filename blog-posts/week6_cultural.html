                <p class="lead">Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristice, a negative stereotype about one's group.</p>
                <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
                <p>Stereotype threat can happen to anybody. It happens when you feel that you may be confirming a negative stereotype about your group. A few symptoms of stereotype threat are anger, being self-conscious, feeling uncomfortable, timid, etc... Consequences of stereotype threat can be pushing people away, performing worse at a given task, or in extreme cases, violence. A couple of ways you can try to reduce the effects of stereotype threat are making people feel safe, and relating to the person through your own personal stories</p>

                <h3>My Personal Story</h3>
                <p>Since relating to others with person stories of your own can help reduce the effects of stereotype threat, here is my story. My first job out of college I was hired on along with 2 other guys for a specific project. The two other guys that were hired were minorities and I am white. The job was funded by the state and the state has very strict rules protecting minories, and they were enforced. The guys on job had been working together for a few months before we started and thought that the new hires should be hazed. Because the other two guys were minorites, they were protected. If they had been hazed and reported it, the entire $40 million contract could be lost. This left just one new hire to haze, yours truly.</p>
                <p>It began innocently enough with a few jokes and a nickname, but after a few months I couldn't go anywhere on site without hearing these little jokes. And it was all day, every day. It became so bad my work began to suffer. Then I got to the point where I was so angry I tried defending my self by making fun of anyone who made fun of me. That is a losing battle when you are alone in a situation like that. It got so bad at one point, that I threatened one of the engineers right in fron of the Project Manager. By the time it got to this point and some of them began to realize they crossed a line, it was too late. I felt like everybody hated me and I could feel the mood in the room change the instant I walked in.</p>
                <p>My saving grace came about 7 months into the project. They needed one person from the office to stay and manage a night crew of 3 guys. Miraculously I got the position. Almost immediately my work started to improve. I became really good friends with the night crew guys and I started to actually like my job. The work had not changed, my position or pay had not changed. I no longer had these guys taunting me for being the new guy. In this story I felt stereotype threat because of my professional position. I felt attacked and almost brought it to the extreme of the spectrum, violence. I am glad it did not come to that, and I hope I can prevent situations like this in the future by implementing this few simple strategies.</p>
