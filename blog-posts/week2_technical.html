		<h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Margin - A margin is the transparent space beween the border and the edge of the page. </li>
				<li>Border - The border surrounds the padding and the content and can be different colors.</li>
				<li>Padding - The padding is the clear area around the content.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div id="section2">
		<h2>Classes and Ids</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Classes should be used multiple times throughout the page</li>
				<li>Ids should only be used once, they are specific.</li>
			</ol>

	  	<h3>Relative, absolute, and fixed positioning</h3>
	  		<ul>
	  			<li>Relative positioning - a relatively positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.</li>
	  			<li><strong>Absolute positioning - an absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position ofther than static.</strong></li>
	  			<li>Fixed positioning - an element with fixed postion is positioned relative to the browser window.</li>
	  		</ul>
	  	</div>
	  	<div id="section4">
	  	<h4>Display inline vs. inline blocks</h4>
	  		<ul>
	  			<li>Display inline - takes up only as much width as it needs, and does not foce new lines</li>
	  			<li>Inline blocks - takes up full width available, with a new line before and after.</li>
	  		</ul>
	  	</div>
	  	<h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
	  	<p>Margins, borders and padding can be confusing at first, but are actually very simple. If you think your border is too close to the edge of the screen you would use margins. If you want to enclose your content you can add a border. Sometimes the content is too close to the border, that is where padding comes in to play. Classes and ids are very similar, except for one major differenct. Classes should be used multiple times throught you document, whereas ids are should be for individual parts and only used once. When you want your text to just go to start on the top left, fixed postioning would work best. If you are looking to offset some text from previous text you should use relative positioning. Finally, when you are looking to put text anywhere on the page absolute positioning will be your best option.  </p>
