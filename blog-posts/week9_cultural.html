                <h3>Formulating and Phrasing Questions</h3>
                <p>Formulating and phrasing questions the right way can sometimes be difficult. I have noticed with myself, when I am learning a new material, it can sometimes be hard to come up with the right question when I am not familiar with all the new terminology. I had a frustrating experience when I first started Phase 0 of DBC. I had just learned of this new app called Lingo and I decided to test it out during my first week of Ruby. When I came across a problem I tried my best to explain it on the new app and got a surly remark in reply. So I tried to rephrase the question, which honestly was probably much worse than the original. I realized this after I had sent the message, and I tried to apologize saying it was the first question I had ever asked on this app. By this time the person on the other end was no longer willing to help me and I simply logged off. This reminded me of my semester abroad in Spain where I could not express myself as much as I would have liked.</p>

                <h3>How to ask good questions:</h3>
                <p>You can start by knowing all the terms you will need to use. Run through your question a few times before asking it and makes sure you can properly explain every part of your question.
                Make sure you check your spelling, grammar, and punctuation. If your question is sloppy, people will assume your code is too. 
                Pretend you are talking to a busy colleague. Keep your question short, but do not leave out important details. These details can include: error messages, key API's, or unusual circumstances. Post only the bit of code you are having trouble getting to work. If somebody is taking time out of their busy schedule to help you, don't make them search for your problem. Point it out to them and be very clear on the issue.</p>
                <p>Below is a good example of a question a student posted on the DBC community page. This student explains right where they are having the problem and elaborates for better clarification.</p> 
                <br><p>
                I'm having a hard time with the jQuery challenge, specifically Release 2, where we have to use the html() method to set the second h1 text. Does anyone know if there is a way to use jQuery to select just that particular h1 without giving it a unique class or id first? Like, selecting an element within a parent element that has a particular class? Thanks!ï»¿</p>   
                <p>Below is a bad example of a question somebody post on stackoverflow.com.</p>
                <br><p>
                Oh my god - my code is all messed up!! It looks crazy!!</p>
                <br><p>
                Look: http://www.nissanguild.com</p>
                <br><p>
                The PHP is not even rendering properly? Can someone look at the source and figure this out?</p>
                <br><p>
                It is obvious this last example was just looking for someone to do their work for them. They have the lowest vote total I have ever seen with a -8. Their grammar is terrible, the are not specific at all, and they just posted a link to their "broken code".</p>
