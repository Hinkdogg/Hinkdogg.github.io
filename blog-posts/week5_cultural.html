                <p class="lead">Going into a pairing session can sometimes be an intimedating experience. Especially when you have never met your partner before and you aren't supposed to look at any of the material beforehand. Below is my experience with pairing and receiving feedback from others.</p>
                <h3>Pairing</h3>
                <p>When going into a pairing session I like to make things as comfortable as possible. Before my new pair and I start on any work I like to ask them how they are doing and have a little conversation to get to know them better. I have found that this will make it easier for both parties to speak up later in the exercise and more likely to voice their opinion. </p>
                <p>Personally, I enjoy pairing with others. I have found that more often than not I benfit technically from pairing sessions. I also find myself more engaged when I have someone right there with me. I am not as easily distracted or as easily discouraged. </p>

                <h3>Feedback</h3>
                <p>When I recieved my feedback I was a little upset but not surprised. I was not upset with the individual giving the feedback, I was more upset with myself. There seemed to be a trend in my feedback that said I was lacking technically. I knew this prior to reading feedback, but it hit harder seeing it in print. I don't want to make excuses, but I was working 50+ hours a week and attempting to complete all my assigned work on time. I realized last week that I can't do both, or at least be successful at both DBC and work, so I quit. No more excuses and now that I have a lot more time to study, I am hoping that I can contribute more technically to pairing sessions.</p>
                <p>Now that I have focused on the negative feedback, time for the positive. On almost all my feedback I got "always" on giving 100%, making my pair feel respected, and the culture benfited from me being on the team. For those of you keeping score at home that is 1 negative to 3 positives! I am really happy about the positive feedback, because technically lacking is a very specific thing that I can work on. When people enjoy working with you and feel respected by you that is something that is hard to teach. It is a much more abstract concept that is not as easily defined as "technically lacking." Overall, I liked the pairing sessions and found the feedback helpful. </p>
