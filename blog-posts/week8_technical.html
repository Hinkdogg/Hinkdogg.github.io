  <h1>Rails</h1>
  <p>Rails is an open source web application framework written in Ruby. This means Rails was designed to support the development of dynamic websites, web applications, web services and web resources. Rails provides a library for database access that extends the Ruby programmin language. This makes it easier to learn and reuse code. </p>

     <p>Many frameworks use model-view-controller or MVC patterns to organize application programming. A model in the Ruby on Rails framework maps to a table in a database, and a Ruby file. In the app/models directory, the User, usually defined as user.rb, will be linked to the tabel users in the database. View in the default configuration of Rails is an erb file, which is compiled to HTML at run-time.Controller is a component of Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application by determining which view file to render. To break this down even further, a MVC breaks down an application into the underlying data and business logic (model), presentation of data to users (the view), and the code that orchestrates the interatction between model and views (controllers).</p>
     <p>Rails allows programmers to use the Ruby language without having to implement all the required infrastructure. This makes it a lot quicker to set up standard functions, and it is less likely bugs will be introduced. Rails is an "opinionated" framework which means it has a set way of doing things. This means it will behave the in the same way from application to application and developer to developer. Rails is open-source which means it has a big community. You can go online and find somebody who has had the same problem as you, and somebody else who has already solved it. Rails applications can also be put together very quickly without sacrificing quality. All of these benefets put together make Rails one of the best frameworks to learn how to code.</p>
