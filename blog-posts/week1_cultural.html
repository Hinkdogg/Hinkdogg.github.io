				<p>Based on the video, I think DBC seems like a crazy experience. We are going into this experiment that we know will be extremely hard and that will kick our ass day in and day out. It will push us faster and further than we have probably ever been pushed, but we will have a supportive community around us, helping us along the way. And I think that going beyond our limits is the only way we grow.

We will get our of DBC what we put in. We will have a supportive community and all the information in front of us, but nobody can force you to learn. We need to ask questions and not be afraid to say I don't know. We will only be able to take that next step if we are honest with ourselves.

I really enjoy working with others and problem solving. I think this type of learning environment was made for me and I am very excited to be immersed in it. My expectations of DBC really have not changed after watching this video. I did a lot of research on DBC before I even applied.

With all of that being said I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous. I am extremely nervous to quit a steady, good paying job to take a class with no guarantees at the end. This is a big risk for me and sometimes I feel a little overwhelmed, but I just need to take it one step at a time and I will be successful.</p>
