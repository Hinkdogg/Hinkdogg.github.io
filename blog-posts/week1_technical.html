			<h1><center><strong>Facebook</strong></center></h1>
				<p>This is one of my favorite sites because it usually has a lot of interesting content and it helps me feel connected with people I would more than likely lose contact with. 
When I first open the site my eyes are drawn towards the center of the screen, after I take a step back my attention is drawn slightly to the right of the center, where the advertising is.
The most important area of the site for the user is the center or the newsfeed. 
I would describe <span class="blue">Facebook is basic, simple, pretty, bright, and neat.</span>
It is hard to stay in touch with so many people as you grow up. Facebook helps you stay connected without actually interacting with everybody.
The content is people’s personal lives and things they are interested in.
When talking about the content on Facebook it can be anything from serious to funny, political, personal, or just interesting
I think Facebook is easy to navigate from the homepage. 
It is very easy to browse through all the content on the site. All of the recent content from your friends is in order from top to bottom and also is based on whose page you visit the most.
I think Facebook is a great tool and a great way to stay connected, but is often overused. If I do not go on often I feel happy to see what my friends and family have been up to, but if I go on too often, like when I am bored, I feel like I am wasting my time.
Facebook does sell things, but I have never bought anything on there. It is not a site I go to to make purchases.</p>

			<h2><center>Imgur</center></h2>
				<p>Imgur is one of my favorite sites because it has random, often hilarious images with just as funny comments. When you open the website your eyes are drawn to “The Front Page” mostly because that is almost all there is except for a header. <span class="red">Imgur is dark, basic, squared, simple, and almost cluttered.</span> Imgur does not really solve any problems, it is just an image based website to share whatever content you feel like sharing. The content ranges from funny to sad, happy to heartbreaking and even political. Since there are very generic sections on Imgur it is pretty difficult to find a specific image from the home page or any other. I mostly find myself scrolling through the main page to find things which is not very time efficient. If I go on Imgur for short periods of time I feel rejuvenated, but if I stay on for more than 10 - 15 minutes in one sitting I feel like I have wasted a lot of time. And yes I have stayed on this site for way more that 15 minutes more times than I would like to admit. This site does not sell anything.</p>

			<h3><center>TheClymb</center></h3>

			<p>TheClymb.com is one of my favorite sites because it sells a lot of gear and has vacation deals I am interested in. Your eyes are drawn to the center of the page both when you open it and when you take a step back. This is because this is the most important area of the site. These are the deals of the day or specials they may have. I would describe TheClymb as basic, dark, simplistic, equilateral, and almost cluttered. This is your one stop shop for all the outdoor gear and vacation deals that are currently out there. This is a fun, practical, interesting, cost-efficient, and smart site. 
From the home page it is somewhat easy to find what you are looking for. There are different sections, but mostly I just browse the site. I would say it is the same to find things whether you are looking on the homepage or on another page because of the different sections at the top. But all the content is mostly on the homepage. I feel excited when I am on this site, because they have great deals. I have purchased a few vacations and other miscellaneous things from this site.</p>
