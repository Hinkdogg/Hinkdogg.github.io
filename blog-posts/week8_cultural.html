                <p class="lead">Conflict with others can sometimes lead to shame. It is how you deal with that shame that is important.</p>
                
                <p>A time in my life when I had an emotional conflict with someone was back in college. I was planning on living with two of my friends, but we ended up finding a 4 bedroom house for cheap. We needed another roommate and my girlfriend at the time thought it would be a good idea for her friend to live there as our fourth roommate. Things were fine for the first semester, but the second semester was a different story.</p>

                <p>The first semester she would complain a lot about things like cleanliness. I mean, we were 3 guys living away from home in a house for the first time in our lives. When we came back after Christmas break, the nagging got much worse. One of my roommates would argue with her, while my other roommate and myself just tried to ignore her. She felt that nobody was on her side and she withdrew. After a few months of this she ended up moving out with less than 2 months left of school.</p>

                <p>When I think back to this time, I feel bad for our fourth roommate. I feel I could have done more to make her feel part of the group. I handled the situation poorly because I did not see the same problem she did and I ignored the situation all together. My actions led to her moving out. This made the living situation better, but it ruined a good friendship. If I could go back I would try harder to meet her needs, and try harder to compromise.</p>

                <p>From this experience I have learned that just because you don't see a problem with something does not mean there is no problem. Our problem started out small and snowballed into something that there was no coming back from. If there is a problem with someone in your group of friends, classmates, or co-workers you need to nip it in the bud as soon as possible. It can lead to one of the poles represented on the compass of shame and can have negative consequences.</p>
