  <h1> Responsive Web Design: What is it and how to use it </h1>
  <p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities. In other words, the website should have the technology to automatically respond to the user’s preferences. This would eliminate the need for a different design and development phase for each new gadget on the market. </p>

     <h1>What is Fluid-layout?</h1>
     <p>Liquid Layouts

The first basic difference between the fixed-width type of layout we’ve just analyzed and liquid layouts is the measurements of their size. The fixed-width layouts are measured in pixels, but for liquid or fluid layouts, dimensions are defined in percentages, and as you might expect, this affords greater malleability and fluidity. In other words, by setting a percentage, you won’t have to think about device size or screen width, and consequently, you can find a reasonable solution for each case because your design’s size will adapt to the size of the device used.

Liquid layouts are closely linked to media queries and special styles for optimization. Percentage-based widths alone will likely not be enough to accommodate your design for a large variety of display sizes. We will see later how to get a perfect result from liquid layouts.</p>

    <h1>Jonathan's Thoughts on RD</h1>  
      
Responsive design and fluid layouts is extremely important today with all the different devices out there. It used to be that you would need 2 seperate websites, one for mobile devices and one for desktops. Now with using percentages instead of pixels we can adjust our website to fit on whatever device the user is using. This makes for a more user friendly experience.

    <div class="reflection">
      Add html tags where necessary to make the information make sense. 
      You don't need to keep these questions visible.
      <ul>
        <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
        <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
        <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
        <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</a>></li>
