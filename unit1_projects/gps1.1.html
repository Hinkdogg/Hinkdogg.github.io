        <h1>Navi Is:</h1>
        <p>the person who is directing the process. The navigator must have a vision of what they want and convey it clearly to the driver. The navigator must also be willing to deviate from the original plan. Things come up and will require change. This is why communication between the navigator and driver is so important.</p>

        <h1>Why Pair Program?</h1>
        <p>Pair programming is collaboration built upon a foundation of respect and courtesy. It is important to the DBC experience because students must learn to code and share ideas together in order to create the best product. If we cannot clearly articulate our learnings or receive other people's opinions, our code (and our lives!) will never reach it's full potential.</p>

        <h1>Driver Is:</h1>
        <p>the person who does the typing of code. The driver must listen to the ideas of the navi and do their best to execute the syntax required. Although it is up to the navi to do the directing and talking, the driver should discern when he should give constructive input.</p>

        <h1>Jon's Reflection</h1>
        <p>Pairing for the first time was a little intimidating because you are not sure what to expect. You are meeting two new people for the first time. One of them is grading you while you are working with the other. It can take a little time to get used to, but overall I think my first experience went pretty well. I think the hardest part was knowing when to lead and when to listen.</p>

        <h1>Ed's Reflection</h1>
        <p>Pairing for the first time makes you a little anxious. You're trying to feel the other person out while trying to accomplish a goal. I didn't want to insult my pair by assuming he knew nothing. But on the other hand, I didn't want to be intimidating by bringing up a bunch of concepts he may not be comfortable with yet. In the end, I really enjoyed it because we were honest. We both felt comfortable asking questions and asserting ourselves when we were sure about our logic. One thing that didn't work was finding a good place to switch off between navi/driver. We changed our p</p>
