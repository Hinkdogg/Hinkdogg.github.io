  <h1>Hashes</h1>
  <p>Hashes are a collection of key-valued pairs. What this means is you create a key, which can be any object. For our example of hash, we will make our first key 'dog'. Now you must assign a value to your object(dog) which we will call canine. So here is what it will look like:

    hash = {'dog'=>'canine'}

  Now that we have our hash, we can call it by typing:
    puts hash['dog'] and it will give us 'canine'.

  Another cool thing about hashes is that if you reference a key that doesn't exist it will return a default value.</p>

    <div id="arrays">
     <h1>Arrays</h1>
     <p>Arrays are a list of data. Unlike hashes where you can index a hash with an object of any type, arrays are indexed with integers. An example of an array would be:

      array = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')

      What I mean by an array being indexed by integers is, in our array of 4 letters, letter 'a' would have an index integer of 0. Letter 'b' would have an idex letter of 1, 'c' would be 2, and 'd' would be 3.</p>

      <p>Knowing when to use a hash and when to use an array can be tricky. I will do my best to help you know which is best for you to use. If you are want to call a specific value later in your code, hash would be easiest for you in this case. Such as John has a Chevy, Bob has a Dodge, Adam has a Ford. These keys and values will be linked and it will be easy to call on them later in the code.

        Arrays are best if you have a lot of data and you want to work with that data as a whole. With an array you can sort the data however you want, use just evens or odds, reverse it, etc... But overall you are still working with the set as a whole instead of calling out individual elements.</p>
