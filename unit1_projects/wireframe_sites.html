				<p>The webssite Imgur.com is not solving any real world problems. It is just getting information one person thinks is interesting or funny and sharing it with the world. Most of the content is intended to be funny, but there is also news posted on the site which I find fasinating. The best part about it is you get different points of views from people that are actually there and outside people that are well informed on the subject. 

					The biggest visual challenge is that it is a wesite full of random images. That is a lot of images they need to distribute with only a limited amount of space. Technicially it is not limited, but people will lose interest if they can just scroll forever. They do have a few categories they break things up to like: Hot, New, Top Week, Top Day, etc... But mostly the site is just a lot of random images. It may not be the worlds most practical site, but it is worth visiting.</p>
