# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? I've learned practice makes perfect, but I still get hung up on simple things when I am working solo.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too) I enjoy design and user experience when everything is flowing. The times you stumlbe and can't seem to find the answers anywhere really test your patience. 
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work? I started with a frame and had an idea of what to do and just worked from the top down. I tried putting the header and footer as the same id in the css and it had worked previously for me, but not today.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next? I am happy with my current site, but I would like to go more in depth and have more video and image content if I had more time.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool? I think it always is hard to apply the material you've learned the first few times. I like when the website comes out the way you had orignally intended.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it. http://www.w3schools.com/ is my go to site.
