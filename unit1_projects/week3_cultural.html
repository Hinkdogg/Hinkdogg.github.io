  <h1> Gregorc Thinking Style </h1>
  <p> I should start doing more pairs than the required amount. I have noticed the material does seem easier when I work with someone else, even if my pair is not necessarily more knowledgeable on the subject.

I should also start making broad or general guidelines for myself. I don't like having everything laid out in front of me step by step, but I do think knowing my general direction is a good thing. </p>

  <h1> Biggest Struggle So Far </h1>
  <p> One major thing I have been dealing with is my time restriction. I work 40+ hours a week with over an hour commute each way. I try to work on DBC material every night and then spend almost my entire weekend working on DBC material as well. I have been debating on whether or not I should quit my job early and focus solely on DBC. It is a struggle because I want to succeed and put my all into DBC, but I also need to support myself.The biggest struggle for me so far in my Phase 0 experience has been finding the time to work on all the material. I feel like there have been times when I could have done better on my assignments or dug a little deeper in my research, but I just simply don't have the time right now. This issue is because of my current job and all the time I need to put into that.</p>

  <h1> Growth vs. Fixed Mindset </h1>
  <p> For Growth vs. Fixed Learning Style need to work on my on a few areas where I think I partially fall in the fixed mindset. Sometimes I look at a problem as either right or wrong, I fail to see the potential learning that can come out of a wrong answer. Knowledge isn't a destination, it is a journey. I need to realize I will never know everything and no matter how good I get at any one thing I will still need to turn to others for help sometimes.  </p>
