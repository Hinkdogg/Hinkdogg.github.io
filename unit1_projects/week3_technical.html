  <h1> JavaScript and why it is important in web development</h1>
  <p>JavaScript is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and after the document content that is displayed. This means the functionality of JavaScript allows for a better user experience by creating transitional effects such as fading and sliding animation. JavaScript is an open source framework which also helps with its popularity. </p>

     <h1>JavaScript Advantages</h1>
     <p>Some of the great things about JavaScript are it is pretty straightforward, you can see how the author created the effect in JavaScript using the page source in the Navigator, and it is fast.
I say it is straightforward because if you want to trigger some kind of action when the user clicks something, just access an onClick event even handler associated with the button object. Being able to see how the author created certain effects in JavaScript can help other programmers get new ideas and implement them into their own work.  JavaScript is fast because it is interpreted rather than being compiled which can save the user anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes.</p>

    <h1>JavaScript Disadvantages</h1>  
      
A few of the limitations I found while researching JavaScript are it depends a lot on the browser, cannot access web pages hosted on a different domain, and it does not have multithreading. JavaScript depends a lot on the browser it runs on and browsers interpret JavaScript differently as the browsers have diverse JavaScript engines. You cannot access files that belong to a different domain name using solely JavaScript. It also does not have multithreading capabilities which is a technique by which a single set of code can be used by several processors at different stages of execution.
