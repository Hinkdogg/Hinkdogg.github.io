  <h1>Problem</h1>
  <p> In business work teams today many companies allow their teams or individuals to bring their own devices to work on.
  This means the business world is seeing more smart phones and 
  tablets. These smartphones and tablets are linked to the corporate data center or application center. The positives of this are people can now be more productive. Employees can now take their work with them and have it right at their finger tips where ever they are. They also may feel more confident on a device that they are used to, instead of getting a new device in which they are unfamiliar.  

  The problem with the smartphones and tablets being linked to the corporate data center is that it creates security challenges that will require a well-thought out enterprise framework. Currently, the top 3 risks for data on smartphone and tablets are data leaks resulting from device lost or stolen, unintentional disclosure of data, and attacks on decommissioned devices. 
  
  Earlier this year Apple had a major security problem which forced them to rush out a patch for its iOS7 and iOS6 operating systems. Before the patch, your browser could not verify the authenticity of an ecryption certificate making it easy for hackers to pretend to be your bank, or credit card application form and steal your information.</p>

  <h1>Hypothetical Solutions</h1>
  <p>Since validating the security certificates that are sent back and fourth when you're establishing a secure connection, a short term solution could be issuing standard secure devices to all the employees to ensure a secure connection. Another option would be to limit the amount of data that a mobile device can access. This would vary from company to company and may be hard to accomplish for smaller companies. The third and best option would be turn to the developers of the world to create a secure platform that can easily be used by any device.There are companies out there that offer services similar to this like "Good Technology", but based on what I have read it seems like that would be for just a solution specifically for whichever company highered "Good" This, once again, may be a problem for smaller companies. I believe in the future developers will come up with a secure way to access data bases through mobile devices on a secure network. And who knows, maybe somebody in our Bootcamp will be a developer in securing mobile devices</p>
