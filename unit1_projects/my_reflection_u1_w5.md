# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? My biggest problem is going from work mode to study mode when I get home.
* How will you combat that? I will combat this by using the Headspace app I just downloaded on my iPhone.
* What techniques will you try? I plan on doing Sensory Meditation and any suggestions the Headspace app has for me.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0? I plan on meditating after work and when I feel bogged down studying. I plan on keeping up with the material assigned and keeping a clear head will help me focus.
